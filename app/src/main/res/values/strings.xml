Once in this position, push the hips backward and allow the chest to move forward. This small movement allows us to engage our posterior chain and remain balanced. Once we are in position, kick the nonstance leg out to the side and back in a slow and controlled manner. The distance the leg moves out to the side is not our main concern. Focus on keeping the stance leg in a stable and unwavering position during the entire exercise. "</string>
    <string name="squat_bracing_process">Squat bracing process</string>
    <string name="squat_bracing_process_description">Step 1: Lie on the ground with your back to the floor. Your knees can stay bent for comfort. Step 2: Activate the muscles on all sides of your core, a process called co-contraction. A verbal cue I like to use is to brace yourself as if you were about to receive a punch to the gut. This should create a feeling of firmness around your entire lower torso. Place your hands on your stomach and on your side. You should feel the muscles under your hands tense as they activate. Improper bracing will only activate our rectus abdominus (our sixpack muscle).</string>
    <string name="bird_dog_progression">Bird dog progression</string>
    <string name="bird_dog_progression_description">Step 1: From the all-fours position (quadruped), place a PVC pipe or cane along the back as shown. At all times, the PVC should be in contact with the back to ensure proper spinal alignment. Step 2: Once you find the neutral position, re-create that co-contraction of the core you learned from level one. This bracing effort will create the stability needed for the next few steps. Step 3: Next, lift your arms up toward your head (one at a time) and back toward the starting position by your side. During this arm movement, your lower back should remain in a stable, braced position. It is important to breathe first and then brace your core. Don’t hold your breath during this movement. Let your breath out slowly through pursed lips (as if you have a straw in your mouth). Step 4: Once this stage is mastered, the second step is to perform the movement with one leg at a time. Step 5: The next stage is one where both the legs and arms are moving. Start by moving your right arm and left leg at the same time. Step 6: The last stage is where the arm and leg on the same side are moving</string>
    <string name="zombie_front_squat">Zombie front squat</string>
    <string name="zombie_front_squat_description">Step 1: Assume a front squat position with the bar held on top of the chest and shoulders. Step 2: Take your hands away from the bar and hold them out in front of you. This should look like the starting position of the bodyweight squat. Step 3: Use the proper breathing and bracing pattern to stabilize your core properly. Take a big breath into your stomach followed by a strong brace of your core muscles. Step 4: Next, perform the front squat to full depth while trying to maintain the bar in the same position. In order to stay balanced, the bar must track over the middle of your foot the entire time. Inability to adequately maintain core stability and stay balanced will force the arms to fall forward. This will cause the bar to roll off the shoulders and drop to the ground.</string>
    <string name="prayer_stretch">Prayer stretch</string>
    <string name="prayer_stretch_description">Start in a kneeling position. Sit your hips back on your feet and push your hands out in front of you (one hand on top of the other).

    <string name="external_rotation_press">External rotation press</string>
    <string name="external_rotation_press_description">Step 1: (Row) Grab a resistance band with your right hand. Pull the band toward you in a rowing motion. Your hand should finish directly in front of your elbow with your arm parallel to the ground. This engages the muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade. Step 2: (External rotation) From this position, rotate the shoulder backward. Your hand should now be facing the ceiling with your elbow bent to ninety degrees like an L. Step 3: (Press) Next, push your hand overhead and hold for five seconds. The muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade should be working hard to keep your arm from falling forward. Step 4: Next, reverse the pattern and return to the start position. Lower the arm to the L position. Rotate forward until your arm is parallel to the ground. Finally, press your arm forward to end the movement.</string>
